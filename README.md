# AI Passport

## Introduction

**AI Passport** is a system that generates unique cryptographic passports for machine learning models and verifies that
outputs are genuinely produced by those models. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques—including Zero-Knowledge
Proofs via the [EZKL](https://docs.ezkl.xyz/getting_started/) library for local models
and [TLSNotary](https://tlsnotary.org/about) for remote models—this system provides a robust framework for tracking and
authenticating AI-generated content.

In the current landscape of artificial intelligence, particularly with the proliferation of large language models (
LLMs), AI systems are increasingly integrated into applications that significantly impact society. These models are
employed in diverse domains ranging from customer service automation and content generation to decision-making processes
in finance and healthcare. While they offer unprecedented capabilities, their widespread adoption also raises
significant concerns about accountability, trust, and safety.

### Motivation

A pressing challenge in the AI community is the inability to track the AI model produced content. This issue becomes
critical in scenarios where an AI system generates harmful, misleading, or
controversial content—such as disinformation, biased recommendations, or dangerous instructions. Affected parties,
researchers, or regulators need reliable methods to authenticate the source of such outputs to hold the appropriate
entities accountable and shut down malicious activities.

Existing mechanisms are insufficient for several reasons:

- **Centralization and Control**: Current solutions often rely on centralized platforms provided by AI service
  providers (e.g., sharing conversation histories through an AI provider's interface). These platforms can alter or
  remove content, and providers may have incentives to hide or deny dangerous behaviors exhibited by their models to
  protect their interests or reputation.

- **Lack of Tamper Resistance**: Without cryptographic guarantees, it is difficult to prove that an AI output has not
  been tampered with or fabricated. This undermines trust in digital evidence and hampers efforts to address malicious
  use cases.

- **Regulatory Compliance and Governance**: As governments and organizations develop regulations around AI usage, the
  ability to verify AI outputs becomes essential for compliance, auditing, and enforcement of policies aimed at ensuring
  AI safety and ethical standards.

**AI Passport** addresses these challenges by providing decentralized, cryptographic methods for users to prove that a
particular AI output was generated by a specific model at a specific time. By generating unique cryptographic passports
for machine learning models and enabling the verification of outputs through Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Multi-Party
Computations, the
system enhances accountability and transparency in both local and remote settings.

#### Example Use Cases

Consider the current AI System, such as ChatGPT, starts to misbehave and generate harmful content to a tiny fraction of
users. Such as the recent case where AI was writing first to users. Without the AI Passport, it would be difficult to
confirm the issue, as both the regular users and AI Provider can claim that the AI was not responsible for the content,
and instead it was the user who faked the conversation. Even when users share the conversation history, the AI Provider
can delete the conversation from their servers, making it impossible to verify the authenticity of the content. This
provides an option for the AI Provider to deny the issue and continue to operate without any consequences.

With the AI Passport, the user can generate a cryptographic proof of the conversation and share it with the AI Provider
and the wider community. Anyone can then verify the proof and confirm that the content was indeed generated by their AI
model and not fabricated by the user. This ensures that the AI Provider is held accountable for the harmful content and
takes appropriate measures to address the issue.

### Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Accountability**: Enables users to hold AI providers accountable by providing undeniable proof of the
  origin of AI outputs.

- **Trustless Verification**: Allows any party to independently verify the authenticity of an AI output without relying
  on the trustworthiness of the AI provider or intermediaries.

- **Privacy Preservation**: Utilizes cryptographic techniques that do not require revealing sensitive information about
  the model's internal parameters or the user's input data.

- **Resistance to Tampering**: Provides strong cryptographic guarantees that make it computationally infeasible to forge
  or alter proofs, ensuring the integrity of the verification process.

- **Compliance Support**: Assists organizations in meeting regulatory requirements by enabling transparent auditing and
  verification of AI outputs.

> **Note**: This is an experimental project and should be used with caution. It is not intended for production use
> without further testing and validation.

### Remote Operations

1. **anthropic-conversation**

---

## Local Operations

Local operations involve generating a passport for your model, attributing content to the model, and verifying the
attribution. These operations are performed locally on your machine.

![Local Operations](docs/decentralized_id_diagram.png)

### Step 1: Create a Passport for the Model

Generate a unique passport for your ONNX model. The passport acts like a human passport, uniquely identifying the model
and including metadata.

**Command**:

```bash
cargo run --release -- local create-passport model/network.onnx --save-to ./model
```

**Explanation**:

- `local`: Specifies that the operation is for a local model.
- `create-passport`: The command to generate the model's passport.
- `model/network.onnx`: The path to your ONNX model file.
- `--save-to ./model`: *(Optional)* Specifies the directory to save the passport. Defaults to the current directory if
  omitted.

**What It Does**:

- **Generates a SHA256 hash of the model's weights**, acting as a unique identifier (`weight_hash`).
- **Generates SHA256 hashes of the verification key (`vk_hash`) and settings (`settings_hash`)**, ensuring consistency
  in the verification process.
- **Computes an overall `model_identity_hash`**, which is a SHA256 hash of the combined `weight_hash`, `vk_hash`, and
  `settings_hash`.
- **Collects metadata** such as generation date, model size, and optional fields like name, description, author, and
  source URL.
- **Creates a JSON passport file** containing the model's unique identity hash, metadata, and identity details.
- **Saves the passport file** as `model_network_<first_10_chars_of_hash>_passport.json` in the specified directory.

**Example Passport JSON**:

```json
{
  "model_identity_hash": "3a896386229e9068be5593b07ca3f2f972e7f93848fe5215c78fc19404cc6a64",
  "generation_date": "2024-09-26 13:29:28",
  "model_metadata": {
    "name": "network",
    "description": null,
    "author": null,
    "size_bytes": 13353,
    "source_url": null
  },
  "identity_details": {
    "vk_hash": "a1b8c7600613a968772bcdbaa6ef24e5af26b2cf3bf89989e4a5685116474b5d",
    "settings_hash": "8b0b9f15d69410fa2bc892c85f66fd391b9f081547855e93228e4066c92ec775",
    "weight_hash": "77de5c5fce890738da6770d51a8c2936ec8701c91d4849f88a8f71265f6fa664"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Attribute Content to the Model

Generate a cryptographic proof that the output is derived from your model given specific input data.

**Command**:

```bash
cargo run --release -- local attribute-content model/network.onnx model/input.json --save-to ./model
```

**Explanation**:

- `local`: Specifies that the operation is for a local model.
- `attribute-content`: The command to attribute content to the model.
- `model/network.onnx`: The path to your ONNX model file.
- `model/input.json`: The path to the input data file.
- `--save-to ./model`: *(Optional)* Specifies the directory to save the output files.

**What It Does**:

- **Generates circuit settings and structured reference strings (SRS)** required for proof generation.
- **Compiles the model into a circuit** using the EZKL library.
- **Sets up proving and verification keys**.
- **Generates a witness** (intermediate computation results).
- **Produces a cryptographic proof** of the model's output given the input data.
- **Creates an attribution certificate** (JSON file) that includes the model's identity hash, generation date, proof,
  settings, and verification key.
- **Saves the attribution certificate** as `model_<first_10_chars_of_hash>_attribution_certificate.json` in the
  specified directory.

**Example Attribution Certificate JSON**:

```json
{
  "generation_date": "2024-09-26 13:29:49",
  "model_id": "3a896386229e9068be5593b07ca3f2f972e7f93848fe5215c78fc19404cc6a64",
  "proof": {
    "...": "..."
  },
  "settings": {
    "...": "..."
  },
  "vk": "..."
}
```

### Step 3: Verify the Attribution

Verify the cryptographic proof and ensure that the output is genuinely produced by your model.

**Command**:

```bash
cargo run --release -- local verify-attribution model/model_network_<model_hash>_passport.json model/model_<model_hash>_attribution_certificate.json
```

**Explanation**:

- `local`: Specifies that the operation is for a local model.
- `verify-attribution`: The command to verify the attribution proof.
- `model/model_network_<model_hash>_passport.json`: The path to the model's passport generated in Step 1.
- `model/model_<model_hash>_attribution_certificate.json`: The path to the attribution certificate generated in Step 2.

**What It Does**:

- **Reconstructs circuit settings and SRS** required for verification.
- **Compiles the model into a circuit**.
- **Sets up verification keys**.
- **Extracts the proof, settings, and verification key** from the attribution certificate.
- **Verifies the proof** using the EZKL library.
- **Computes the model's identity hash** and compares it with the `model_id` in the attribution certificate and the
  passport.
- **Ensures consistency** of the verification key and settings by comparing their hashes.
- **Outputs a success message** if verification passes.

**Note on `<model_hash>`**:

Replace `<model_hash>` with the first 10 characters of your model's identity hash, which is part of the filename of the
generated files.

## Remote Operations

With the addition of remote operations, you can now interact with AI models hosted remotely (e.g., via APIs) and
generate proofs of these interactions. The identity of the model is included in the proof, ensuring that the output is
genuinely produced by the specified model.

The remote operations leverage TLSNotary to generate cryptographic proofs of interactions with AI services. TLSNotary
allows you to prove to third parties that specific communications with an AI service occurred, without revealing the
content of the communication.

![Remote Operations](docs/centralized_id_diagram.png)

### Step 1: Interact with Anthropic's API and Generate an Attribution Proof

Engage in a conversation with an AI assistant (e.g., Anthropic's Claude) and generate a cryptographic proof of the
conversation.

**Command**:

```bash
cargo run --release -- remote anthropic-conversation
```

**Explanation**:

- `remote`: Specifies that the operation is for a remote model or service.
- `anthropic-conversation`: Initiates a conversation with Anthropic's AI assistant and generates a proof of the
  interaction.

**What It Does**:

- **Initiates a Conversation**: Starts an interactive session where you can send messages to the AI assistant and
  receive responses.
- **Generates a Cryptographic Proof**: After the conversation, the application generates a proof that the conversation
  occurred as recorded.
- **Saves the Proof**: The proof is saved to a file named `claude_conversation_proof.json`.

**Sample Output**:

```
🌟 Welcome to the Anthropic Prover CLI! 🌟
This application will interact with the Anthropic API to generate a cryptographic proof of your conversation.
💬 First, you will engage in a conversation with the assistant.
The assistant will respond to your messages in real time.
📝 When you're done, simply type 'exit' or press Enter without typing a message to end the conversation.
🔒 Once finished, a proof of the conversation will be generated.
💾 The proof will be saved as 'claude_conversation_proof.json' for your records.
✨ Let's get started! Begin by sending your first message.

💬 Your message:
> Hello, assistant!
```

After the conversation:

```
🔒 Generating a cryptographic proof of the conversation. Please wait...
✅ Proof successfully saved to `claude_conversation_proof.json`.
🔍 You can share this proof or inspect it at: https://explorer.tlsnotary.org/.
📂 Simply upload the proof, and anyone can verify its authenticity and inspect the details.
```

### Step 2: Verify the Attribution

You can verify the cryptographic proof of a remote AI interaction using two methods: via the TLSNotary Explorer website
or locally through the command-line interface.

#### **Option 1: Website Verification**

To verify the proof using the TLSNotary website, follow these steps:

1. After generating the proof (e.g., `claude_conversation_proof.json`), navigate to
   the [TLSNotary Explorer](https://explorer.tlsnotary.org/).
2. Upload the JSON proof file to the site.
3. The website will analyze the proof and provide confirmation that the conversation occurred exactly as recorded,
   showing details about the interaction (e.g., timestamps, API requests, and responses).

This method is ideal for quick, third-party verification of AI outputs and interactions with remote models.

#### **Option 2: Local Verification**

To verify the proof locally, use the following command:

**Command**:

```bash
cargo run --release -- remote verify-attribution claud_conversation_proof.json
```

**Explanation**:

- `remote`: Specifies that the operation is for a remote model or service.
- `verify-attribution`: The command to verify the attribution proof.
- `claude_conversation_proof.json`: The path to the proof file generated in Step 1.

**What It Does**:

- **Extracts the proof details** from the JSON file.
- **Verifies the proof** using the TLSNotary library.
- **Outputs a success message** if verification passes.
- **Displays the conversation details** (timestamps, API requests, and responses) if verification is successful.

**Sample Output**:
